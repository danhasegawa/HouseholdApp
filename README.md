Using as a model an API that I developed when I was studying Java, this project aims to create an Android application for home budgeting.

The application must allow a person to register their income and expenses for the month, as well as generate a monthly report.

## :bulb: Project Features

A list of income and expenses for the month will be displayed on this home screen.
And in the bottom right corner is a floating button to enter expenses.

Clicking the add button will open this dialogue box in which you can enter the expense's date, description and amount.

And when clicking on the Date button, a calendar will open for the user to select the date.
